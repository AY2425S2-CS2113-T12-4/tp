## Summary of Contributions

### Expenses Summarising

**What it does:**

- Helps users get a summary of all their expenses.
- Provides a summary for all the budgets (if other categories exist; otherwise,
it defaults to the "Overall" category).
- For each budget, the following are displayed:
    - **Budget category**
    - **Total expenses made in this category (in Dollars)**
    - **Spending limit of the category (in Dollars)**

**Justification:**

The `summary` command provides users with a clear overview of their spending and remaining budget, 
helping them make informed financial decisions at a glance.
