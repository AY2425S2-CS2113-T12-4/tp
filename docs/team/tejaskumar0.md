## Summary of Contributions

### Storage Manager Feature
* **Summary**:  
  Developed the `StorageManager` class to handle persistent saving and loading of user data (budgets, expenses, and alerts) to/from a local `.txt` file.
* **Justification**:  
  Enables data persistence across sessions, ensuring users donâ€™t lose their financial records when they restart the app. Designed a readable format for efficient parsing and minimal errors.

### Budget Alert Feature
* **Summary**:  
  Implemented the `Alert` class and integrated it into the `BudgetManager` to allow users to set a custom expense alert threshold.
* **Justification**:  
  Helps users manage overspending by notifying them when their total expenses exceed a predefined limit, promoting better financial discipline.

### Developer Guide
* Documented the storage logic with a UML class diagram.
* Explained how alert checking is triggered after adding new expenses.
