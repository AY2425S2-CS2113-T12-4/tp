### Summary of Contributions

#### Abstract Command Class and Subclasses
* <u>What it does</u>:
  * The abstract command class defines a common structure for different types of commands in the application. It ensures
that all command classes follow a consistent interface, making it easier to extend and maintain. By establishing a 
standardized framework, it simplifies the implementation of various user actions such as adding, editing, 
and deleting expenses.
* <u>Justification</u>:
  * Using an abstract command class provides a reusable foundation for handling different commands, reducing code 
duplication and improving maintainability. By following the Command Pattern, it promotes separation of concerns, making
the system more modular and flexible. This approach helps developers efficiently implement and manage the logic for 
different commands without the need for redundant code.

#### Adding Expenses
* <u>What it does</u>: 
  * Allows users to add new expenses. These expenses contain details such as amount, description, budget
  category and date and time of expenditure. The category and date/time are optional, defaulting to the Overall Budget 
  and the current date and time, respectively.
* <u>Justification</u>:
  * Enables users to efficiently track and record their expenditures, helping them better manage their finances.

#### Editing Expenses
* <u>What it does</u>:
  * Allows users to edit expenses. The amount, description and date and time of expenditure can all be edited. The 
  amount, description and change in date and time are all optional, and can be left out if unchanged.
* <u>Justification</u>:
  * Enables users to update their expenditures, in the event of incorrect logging.
